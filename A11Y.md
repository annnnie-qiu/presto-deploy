# Accessibility (A11Y)

## **1. Inclusive Color Design**
- **Color Blind-Friendly Design**  
  - We ensured the application's color scheme is accessible to users with color blindness or color vision deficiencies by maintaining high contrast ratios and avoiding problematic color combinations. This effort provides an inclusive experience for all users.

## **2. Visual Feedback and Error Handling**
- **Error Popups**  
  - Error popups are designed to provide clear and immediate feedback for invalid user actions, such as entering an invalid email or navigating to a non-existent page. This ensures users are aware of issues and how to resolve them without frustration.

- **Tooltips for Guidance**  
  - Tooltips are included on the presentation page to explain button functionalities. These are keyboard and mouse-accessible, helping users who rely on assistive technologies.

## **3. Keyboard Navigation**
- **Keyboard-Accessible Navigation**  
  - Key interactive elements, such as the slide list, settings options, and navigation bar, are fully accessible via keyboard navigation. This ensures that users who cannot use a mouse can still interact with the application effectively.

## **4. Screen Reader Compatibility**
- **ARIA Roles and Labels**  
  - Key components of the application include proper ARIA roles and labels. For example, buttons, tooltips, and error messages have descriptive labels that allow screen readers to interpret and announce their functions clearly.

## **5. Captcha Accessibility**
- **Human-Verification System**  
  - The CAPTCHA implementation considers accessibility, ensuring it is solvable by users relying on assistive technologies. Alternative text or audio CAPTCHA options are provided for those unable to solve visual challenges.

## **6. Night Mode for Visual Comfort**
- **Reduced Eye Strain**  
  - The inclusion of a night mode reduces strain for users in low-light conditions, making the application comfortable to use at all times of day.

## **7. Dynamic Feedback for Navigation and Content Changes**
- **URL and State Updates**  
  - The application dynamically updates URLs when users navigate between slides, ensuring consistency and context for users relying on assistive tools or browser history.  

- **Preview Features**  
  - Preview options for uploaded thumbnails provide visual confirmation of selected content, supporting users who need clarity before proceeding.

## **8. Accessible Animations**
- **Subtle Animations**  
  - Animations on the welcome page and other areas are designed to be subtle and non-distracting, ensuring they do not negatively impact users with motion sensitivity. Animations follow WCAG guidelines for reduced motion preferences.


  ## **9. Accessibility in Form Design**
- **Input Validation with Feedback**  
  - Input fields, such as those for email and name, include real-time validation with clear error messages to guide users in correcting mistakes.  
  - Labels and placeholders are used effectively, ensuring fields are descriptive and screen-reader friendly.

- **Google Login and Account Creation**  
  - For users who may struggle with traditional registration, Google Login provides an accessible alternative. The system automatically creates an account, reducing the cognitive load for users with difficulties in form completion.

  ## **10. Inclusive Presentation Features**
- **Flexible Slide Navigation**  
  - The presentation page allows users to jump between slides using a side list. This feature minimizes navigation effort and supports users with limited mobility or those relying on keyboard shortcuts.  
  - Slide names are announced to screen readers for clarity.

- **Background Music Options**  
  - Users can add background music for their presentations.
