# UI/UX Enhancements

## **1. Usability and Navigation**
- **Seamless Navigation**
  - The application is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with no confusing layouts or usability issues.
  - Key examples:
    - Users can directly switch between the login and registration pages without unnecessary intermediary steps.
    - The presentation page allows for quick navigation between slides using a side list, enabling users to jump directly to any slide without incremental page-by-page navigation.

- **Dynamic URL Updates**
  - Slide navigation dynamically updates the URL to reflect the current slide, improving consistency and supporting direct deep linking.

## **2. Accessibility**
- **Color Accessibility**
  - We have ensured that our color scheme is friendly to individuals with color blindness or color weakness by maintaining sufficient contrast and avoiding problematic color combinations. This inclusive design enhances usability for all users.

## **3. Visual Feedback and Animation**
- **Welcoming Animations**  
  - The welcome page features subtle animations that add a layer of interactivity and delight for first-time users. This sets a friendly tone for the application.

- **Feedback for User Actions**  
  - Visual cues, such as tooltips on the presentation page and error popups for invalid actions or failed operations, provide immediate feedback, helping users understand the system's responses.

## **4. Enhanced Presentation Experience**
- **User-Controlled Slide Navigation**  
  - Users can freely navigate between slides on the presentation page, aligning with natural expectations and allowing for efficient workflow.

## **6. User-Centric Features**
